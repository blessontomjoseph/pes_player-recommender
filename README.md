# Football Player Recommendation - From PES Data

![poster](images/1_sPWX48ryH5zaaf6YjiMSLw.jpeg)

## Intro
A player recommendation system build for replacing or filling positions in a team

## Background
Often at the end of the season, some players leave, leaving managers in a position to replace their players. in contemporary football, we have seen some million-dollar flop transfers. Some managers are good at choosing players that fit their style and philosophy of playing but others might need some more experience. Which explains what makes a player fit in a team is not just a factor of the player’s attributes but something else that’s common to the entire team itself. a comparison could be modern-day premier league classic Man City vs Liverpool. Liverpool always has fast physical, attacking players but City has more technical players who can control, pass, and things, So how can we replace a player and don’t feel the loss at all? So I wanted to convert all of these available attributes into something that can measure a unique player’s role in a unique position in a unique team
